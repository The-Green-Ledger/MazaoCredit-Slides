## üñºÔ∏è MazaoCredit Slides Repository (Slides Repo)

The **MazaoCredit Slides Repository** is the central location for all public and internal presentation materials. Its primary purpose is to clearly and compellingly communicate the platform's vision, technical execution, and alignment with the hackathon's challenge to mentors, judges, investors, and stakeholders.
